## Introduction
Who doesn't like a nice game of tic-tac-toe to pass the time with a friend? Now, you can do it without wasting any paper! Thats right, this app is an _eco-friendly_ alternative to the old fashioned way of playing.

## How To Play
+ Player 1 starts the game by clicking on any game board possition.
+ Player 2 takes the next turn and and can click anywhere that there is an open space on the game board.
+ Any player to get three spaces in a row, column, or diaganal wins the round.
+ If no player gets three in a row, the game is called as a draw and a new match starts.

## Features
+ Players can simply click within any available box to set their icon (x or o)
+ The app does not let a player choose a box that has already been selected.
+ The app automatically determines a winner
+ If there is no winner, the app declares a draw
+ The wins for each player are automatically stored and shown on each player's side cards
+ If you and your opponent decide to leave and come back to the game at a later time, the wins will still appear in the player's side cards
